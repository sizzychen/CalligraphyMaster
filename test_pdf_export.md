# PDF Export Test

## Optimizations Made:

### 1. Reduced Whitespace
- Header height: 100px → 60px
- Padding: 80px → 40px (20px each side) 
- Title size: 24px → 20px
- Info line spacing: 70px → 50px
- Grid start offset: 20px → 10px

### 2. Multi-page Support Enhanced
- Added `fillPageWithContent()` helper function
- Improved article template handling for large content
- Better page break calculations
- Proper grid filling for remaining spaces on each page

### 3. Content Distribution
- Content characters are now properly distributed across multiple pages
- Each page fills with content first, then empty grids for article template
- Single template works with multi-page as well

## Test Cases to Verify:

1. **Short content (< 1 page)**: Should fill page with content + empty grids
2. **Long content (> 1 page)**: Should create multiple pages with proper distribution
3. **Different grid sizes**: 5, 10, 15 grids per row should all work
4. **With/without pinyin**: Both modes should have proper spacing

## Expected Results:
- Significantly less whitespace in exported PDFs
- Multi-page exports for large content
- Consistent grid layout across pages
- Proper header and spacing on each page
